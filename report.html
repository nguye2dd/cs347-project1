      My client is my mom, and she offers beauty services.
    </li>
    <li>
      All the images I used were ones that my mom took of her clients or that they sent to her.
      All of my content was made from scratch using HTML and CSS. I referenced many online
      resources to help me with styling and using HTML elements but all of the work was done by me.
    </li>
    <li>
      My site contains 5 pages:
      The homepage, which is in index.html 
      The services/pricing page, which is in services.html
      The photo gallery, which is in gallery.html 
      The about us page, which is in about.html
      The contact us page, which is in contact.html 
    </li>
    <li>
      I have a header on each of my 5 pages that includes the business name
      and a navigation bar to the other pages.
    </li>
    <li>
      I have navigation links in my header, which redirects the user to other pages.
      I also have various navigation links in the home page, service page, and about
      us page that redirects users to the contact form to make an appointment. I also
      include navigation links that redirect to a google maps page for locating
      the business and some navigation links to phone numbers. 
    </li>
    <li>
      I added media queries on pages that needed it to change the sizing and layouts
      as the screen gets smaller. Media queries were msotly used on my about page
      and on my navigation bar to make the buttons size proportionally.
    </li>
    <li>
      All of my pages share the same background color and the same layout,
      with the header with the navigation bar and the pages contents below it.
    </li>
    <li>
      I have plenty of images throughout my website. I believe my alt attributes for 
      each image are descriptive enough, and in my photo gallery, when you click on
      a photo, a slideshow comes up with the full size image as well as using the alt
      tag as the images caption.
    </li>
    <li>
      All of my pages contains a favicon. It is a small icon that represents happiness
      from receiving beauty services, which is the goal of the business. I got this icon
      from an external website, which I give proper reference to at the bottom of each
      page.
    </li>
    <li>
      All my images, css and js files are all kept in their own respective folders
      in my project directory.
    </li>
    <li>
      I did not import or use any external/third party tools.
    </li>
    <li>

    </li>
    <li>
      My elements are pretty much aligned in my opinion. Nothing looks out of place.
    </li>
    <li>

    </li>
    <li>
      The contact us page fulfills all of these requies. The form asks for users to enter
      their name, phone number, email address, preferred method of contact, desired service, 
      a file uploader to upload any relevant images, and allows the client to specify any 
      additional information. I also made the name, phone number, email, preferred method 
      of contact required fields, denoted by a red asterick, and used JS to provide proper 
      erro handling for them. If the uder submits the form, but these fields are missing, an 
      alert message pop ups telling the user to fill in the missing required fields. If all
      requirements are satisfied and the client submits the form, an alert message pops up
      displaying a confirmation prompt on the webpage with the information the client entered.
    </li>
    <li>
      My about page contains an external link to a google maps link that shows the exact location
      of the business. At the bottom of the page, I also added a list of beauty product brands
      that my mom usually uses and recommends with links tot heir respective websites.
    </li>
    <li>
      I made sure all my files and source code was neatly organized, with proper
      indentation and used intuitive names for classes and id's
    </li>
    <li>
      On my gallery page, when hovering over a picture, a zoom animation happens.
      The picture zooms enlarges a bit and becomes a bit more transparent like a bubble.
      This was powered using css to scale the picture when hovering over it. I was also 
      able to control the speed of the animation, but ended up setting it at 1 second.
      On my services page also, I created menus for specific services and pricing. I added
      an animaton on the borders using CSS.
    </li>
    <li>
      I have a git respository for my project that I have been making commits to and
      pulling from my apache server.
      <a href="https://github.com/nguye2dd/cs347-project1">https://github.com/nguye2dd/cs347-project1</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      All my filenames only contain lowercase characters that are all alphanumeric
    </li>
    <li>
      My site does have its own domain name.
      <a target="_blank" href="https://project1.nguye2dd-cs347.me/">https://project1.nguye2dd-cs347.me/</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      When I specify my domain name with port 443 over HTTPS
      <a href="https://project1.nguye2dd-cs347.me:443">https://project1.nguye2dd-cs347.me:443</a>
      It loads appropriately.
    </li>
    <li>
      When I specify my domain name with port 80 over HTTP
      <a href="http://project1.nguye2dd-cs347.me:80">http://project1.nguye2dd-cs347.me:80</a>
      It loads appropriately and redirects to port 443.
    </li>
    <li>
      Over the past few weeks, I have commited significant changes to my site regularly.
