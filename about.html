      Hi! My name is Thuy Nguyen (most of my peers call me Tweety, as in Tweety bird) and I am the owner of my beauty 
      business Sophisticuts. I offer various beauty services for 
      all genders, ages, hair types, and skin types. I mainly
      specialize in hair services but also offer predicure,
      manicure, wax, facial, and massage services. Check out a 
      list of my offered services <a href="services.html" target="_blank">here</a>! 
      Beauty services have always been a passion of mine and I believe that everybody
      deserves the best beauty services, which is what I strive to provide to my customers.
      I also love getting to know my customers personallly and have even formed personal
      friendships with many of my customers. About 20 years ago, in 2000, I decided to 
      open up my own beauty salon in <a href="https://www.virginia.org/cities/woodbridge/" target="_blank">
      Woodbridge, VA</a> and named it Sophisticuts. I owned the salon for about 10 years, 
      and now I rent booths in other beauty salons in order to continue offering Sophoisticuts services.
